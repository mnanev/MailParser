# 📧 MailParser

### 📋 Description

The tool is useful for extracting mail headers from multiple `.msg` files. There is no limitation on the number of `.msg` files that can be processed.

### 🚀 How It Works

1. 🛠️ **Update the configuration file** with the correct path where you will place your `.msg` files.
2. ▶️ **Run `MailParserFromMsgFiles.exe`**, and you will receive an output indicating the location of the `MessageHeaderData.txt` file (containing all extracted message headers). All headers from the `.msg` files will be appended to this file.
